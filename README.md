# spotify-ad-killer

I made this because I kept seeing a ton of over-complicated versions of these so I made my own in under a hundred lines. This script automatically detects when a Spotify ad is playing and mutes the app.

## Notes:
- Only works on windows 10/11 (haven't tested on windows 10)
- doesn't work with podcasts lol
- I wouldn't recommend you actually use this I made it in like an hour
